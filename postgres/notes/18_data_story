CHAPTER 18 - TELLING THE STORY OF YOUR DATA
---------------------------------------------------

- 1. Start With a Question

       Start by trying to observe your community around you, and see if you notice changes.
         If you see more 'For Sale' signs popping up around town, start asking questions.
         If you're a journalist, you might find a new story.  If you're a business owner,
         you might find a new marketing opportunity.

       If you see a trend occurring in your industry, you might find a new business
         opportunity.  If you suspect that sales of a product have become sluggish, you
         can use data analysis to adjust your business plan.

       Keep track of these ideas and prioritize them according to their potential value.


- 2. Document Your Process

       Before delving into analysis, consider how to make your process transparent and
         reproducible.  Others should be able to reproduce your work.  

       In addition, make sure you document enough information so that if you set the 
         project aside for several weeks, you won't have a problem picking it up again.


- 3. Gather Your Data

       If you're working for an organization that already has the data you need, you are all set!
         Otherwise, you'll have to do some digging.  

       A good start is to ask experts what sources they use.  Browsing government websites is often
         a good source of data.  If the data spans several years, it is usually better to 
         examine 5-10 years or more, rather than just 1 or 2 years.


- 4. No Data? Build Your Own Database

       Sometimes, no one has the data you need.  If you have the time, patience, and a 
         methodology, you might be able to build your own data set.  


- 5. Assess The Data's Origins

       After you've identified a data set, find as much information about its origins and
         maintenance methods as you can.  Governments and institutions gather data in all sorts
         of ways, and some methods produce data that is more credible and standardized than others.

       The origins of a data set might also affect how you analyze the data and report your
         findings.  For example, the Decennial Census is a complete count of the population, while
         the American Community Survey is drawn from only a sample of households.  It would be
         irresponsible to report on the ACS without considering how the margin of error could 
         make differences between numbers insignificant.


- 6. Interview the Data with Queries

       Once you have your data, understand its origins, and have it loaded into your database,
         you can explore it with queries.  A good place to start is with aggregates.  Counts, sums,
         sorting, and grouping by column values should reveal minimum and maximum values, 
         potential issues with duplicate values, and a sense of the general scope of your data.

       If your database contains multiple, related tables, try joins to make sure you understand
         how the tables relate.  Using LEFT JOINs and RIGHT JOINs should show whether key values
         from one table are missing in another.


- 7. Consult the Data's Owner

       After exploring your database and forming early conclusions about the quality and trends
         you observed, take some time to bring any questions to a person who knows the data well.
         This person might be the agency or firm who gave you the data, or it might be an 
         analyst who worked with the data before.

       To goal is to help do the following:
         - Understand the limits of the data
         - Make sure you have a complete data set
         - Determine whether the data suits your needs


- 8. Identify Key Indicators and Trends Over Time

       When you're satisfied that you understand the data and are confident in its
         trustworthiness, and the appropriateness of your analysis, the next step is to run
         queries to identify key indicators and trends over time.

       To identify trends, use this process:
         - Choose an indicator to track (ie percentage of people in NYC taxis over 60)
         - Track the indicator over multiple years to see how it has changed


- 9. Ask Why

       Data analysis can tell you what happened, but it doesn't usually indicate why something
         happened.  To learn why something happened, it's worth revisiting the data with experts
         in the topic or the owners of the data.


- 10. Communicate Your Findings

       Tips for presenting information:
         - Identify an overarching theme based on your findings
         - Present overall numbers to show the greatest trends
         - Highlight specific examples that support the trend
         - Acknowledge examples counter to the overall trend
         - Stick to the facts
         - Provide expert opinion
         - Visualize numbers using bar charts or line charts
         - Cite the source of the data and what you analysis includes or omits
         - Share your data
