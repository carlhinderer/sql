- Data Capture and Data Analysis

    - Data assets of any organiation are used for 2 purposes:

        1. Operational record keeping
             - Turn the wheels of the organization
             - Optimized to process transactions quickly
             - Deal with one transaction record at a time
             - Do not maintain history, update data to reflect the most current state

        2. Analysis
             - Watch the wheels turn to evaluate performance
             - Ask questions about the business to make sure operations are working correctly
             - Optimized for queries over thousands of transactions


    - Some DW/BI systems are just copies of the operational data stored on a separate hardware
        platform.  These are not typically useful, though.



- Goals of DW and BI

    - The DW/BI system must make information easily accessible.

        - The data should be intuitive and obvious to business users
        - The tools and applications must be simple and easy to use
        - Query results must be returned with minimal wait times


    - The DW/BI system must present information consistently.

        - The data must be credible
        - The data must be carefully assembled, cleaned, QA'ed, and released only when ready
        - Fields and labels should be the same across data sources


    - The DW/BI system must adapt to change.

        - Must handle change gracefully without invalidating existing data or applications
        - If system must be modified, changes should be transparent to users


    - The DW/BI system must present information in a timely way.

        - Raw data may need to be converted into actionable data within hours, minutes, or seconds
        - Business users must have realistic expectations for data when there is little time to clean it


    - The DW/BI system must be a secure bastion that protects the information assets.

        - An organization's information crown jewels are stored in the DW
        - The system must effectively control access


    - The DW/BI system must serve as the authoritative and trustworthy foundation for 
        improved decision making.

        - The DW must have the right data to support decision making
        - We must build a Decision Support System


    - The business users must accept the DW/BI system to deem it successful.

        - The system must be actively used
        - If the system is simple and fast, it will be much more likely to be used



- A DW/BI Manager's Responsibilities

    - Understand the Business Users

        - Understand responsibilities, goals, and objectives
        - Determine the decisions that business users want help making
        - Identify the "best" users who make high-impact decisions
        - Find potential new users


    - Deliver High-Quality, Relevant, and Acessible Information and Analytics

        - Choose the best data sources
        - Make UIs simple and match to users' thinking processes
        - Make sure the data is accurate and can be trusted
        - Continuously monitory the accuracy of data
        - Adapt to changing users and business 


    - Sustain the DW/BI Environment

        - Take a portion of the credit for successes
        - Update the system on a regular basis
        - Maintain the business users' trust
        - Keep users, sponsors, and management happy



- Dimensional Modeling

    - Dimensional modeling is widely preferred, because it addresses 2 requirements:

        1. Deliver information that is understandable to business users
        2. Deliver fast query performance


    - An executive might describe their business as "We sell products in various markets and
        measure our performance over time."  It is natural to think of this business as a 
        cube of data, with edges labeled Product, Market, and Time.


    - Operational systems use 3NF and ERDs to remove redundancy.  This is so that an insert or
        update transaction only has to touch the database in one place.

      However, normalized models are often too complicated for BI queries.  So, we reduce the
        level of normalization when dimensional modeling.
