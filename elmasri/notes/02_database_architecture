- Levels of Data Modeling

    Conceptual = ER Model
    Implementational = Relational Model
    Physical = Record formats, Access paths, and Indexes



- DBMS Implementation

    - Access to disk is normally controlled by the OS.  However, many DBMS's have their own buffer
        management module to schedule disk reads/writes, since this has a considerable effect
        on performance.  

    - The DDL compiler processes schema definitions and stores the metadata in the catalog.  The
        catalog includes the names and sizes of files, names and data types of data items, 
        storage details of each file, mapping information among schemas, and constraints.  

    - The query compiler compiles queries into an internal form.  Then, the query optimizer 
        rearranges and reorders operations, eliminates redundancies, and picks the correct
        algorithms and indexes to use for the query.
