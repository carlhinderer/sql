CHAPTER 12 - ADVANCED QUERIES
---------------------------------------------------

- Using Subqueries

    A subquery is nested inside another query.  Typically, it's used for a calculation or
      logical test that provides a value or a set of data to be passed into the main portion
      of the query.


    # Update, with filtering of the rows we want to update
    UPDATE table
    SET column = (SELECT column
                  FROM table_b
                  WHERE table.column = table_b.column)
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT column
                  FROM table_b
                  WHERE table.column = table_b.column);



- Filtering with Subqueries 

    # Return the US counties that are at or above the 90th percentile for population
    SELECT geo_name,
           state_us_abbr,
           population
    FROM us_counties_2010
    WHERE population >= (
        SELECT percentile_cont(.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population)
        FROM us_counties_2010
    )
    ORDER BY population DESC;



- Using a Subquery to Identify Which Rows to Delete

    DELETE FROM us_counties_2010
    WHERE population < (
        SELECT percentile_cont(.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population)
        FROM us_counties_2010
    );



- Creating Dervied Queries with Subqueries

    If your subquery returns rows and columns of data, you can convert that data to a table
      by placing it in a FROM clause, the result of which is known as a 'derived table'.  A
      derived table behaves just like any other table.


    # Find the average and median of US counties, as well as the difference between them
    SELECT round(calcs.average, 0) AS average,
           calcs.median,
           round(calcs.average - calcs.median, 0) AS median_average_diff
    FROM (
        SELECT avg(p0010001) AS average,
               percentile_cont(.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001)::numeric(10,1) AS median
        FROM us_counties_2010
       )
    AS calcs;

    average    median     median_average_diff
    -------    -------    -------------------
      98233    25857.0                  72376



- Joining Derived Tables

      SELECT census.state_us_abbreviation AS st,
             census.st_population,
             plants.plant_count,
             round((plants.plant_count/census.st_population::numeric(10,1))*1000000, 1) 
               AS plants_per_million
      FROM
      (
          SELECT st,
                 count(*) AS plant_count
          FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
          GROUP BY st
      )
      AS plants
      JOIN
      (
          SELECT state_us_abbreviation,
                 sum(p0010001) AS st_population
          FROM us_counties_2010
          GROUP BY state_us_abbreviation
      )
      AS census
      ON plants.st = census.state_us_abbreviation
      ORDER BY plants_per_million DESC;



- Generating Columns with Subqueries

    We can also generate new columns of data with subqueries by placing a subquery in the
      column list after SELECT.  


    # Get the population of each state, along with the US median
    SELECT geo_name,
           state_us_abbreviation AS st,
           population AS total_pop,
           (SELECT percentile_cont(.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population)
            FROM us_counties_2010) AS us_median
    FROM us_counties_2010;

    geo_name          st    total_pop    us_median
    --------------    --    ---------    ---------
    Autauga County    AL        54571        25857
    Baldwin County    AL       182265        25857
    Barbour County    AL        27457        25857
    Bibb County       AL        22915        25857
    Blount County     AL        57322        25857
    --snip--


    # Calculate the difference between each county's population and the median
    #   for all counties whose population is within 1000 of the median
      SELECT geo_name,
             state_us_abbreviation AS st,
             population AS total_pop,
             (SELECT percentile_cont(.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population)
              FROM us_counties_2010) AS us_median,
             population - (SELECT percentile_cont(.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population)
                   FROM us_counties_2010) AS diff_from_median
      FROM us_counties_2010
      WHERE (population - (SELECT percentile_cont(.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population)
                           FROM us_counties_2010))
      BETWEEN -1000 AND 1000;



- Generating Values for the IN Operator

    # Get employee records for all retirees
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE id IN (
        SELECT id
        FROM retirees
    );



- Checking Whether Values Exist

    The EXISTS subquery is a true/false test.  It returns true if the subquery in parentheses
      returns at least one row.


    # Returns all employees if there is at least one retiree with an 'id'
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT id
        FROM retirees
    );


    # Mimics the behavior of IN
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT id
        FROM retirees
        WHERE id = employees.id
    );


    # Find employees with no corresponding record in retirees with NOT EXISTS
    SELECT fist_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT id
        FROM retirees
        WHERE id = employees.id
    );
    


- Common Table Expressions

    As an alternative to placing subqueries in a FROM clause, we can also create temporary
      tables for querying using 'CTE (Common Table Expressions'.  CTE is a recent addition to
      standard SQL, and is informally called a 'WITH clause'.

    Using a CTE, you can define one or more tables up front with subqueries.  Then, you can 
      query the table results as often as needed in the main query that follows.


    # Determines how many counties in each state have 100K+ people
    WITH
        large_counties (geo_name, st, population)
    AS
        (
            SELECT geo_name, state_us_abbreviation, population
            FROM us_counties_2010
            WHERE population > 100000
        )
    SELECT st, count(*)
    FROM large_counties
    GROUP BY st
    ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

    st    count
    --    -----
    TX       39
    CA       35
    FL       33
    PA       31
    OH       28
    --snip--


    # Same query without a CTE
    SELECT state_us_abbreviation, count(*)
    FROM us_counties_2010
    WHERE population >= 100000
    GROUP BY state_us_abbreviation
    ORDER BY count(*) DESC;



- Example - Derived Tables with CTE

      WITH
          counties (st, population) AS
          (SELECT state_us_abbreviation, sum(population_count_100_percent)
           FROM us_counties_2010
           GROUP BY state_us_abbreviation),
    
          plants (st, plants) AS
          (SELECT st, count(*) AS plants
           FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
           GROUP BY st)
    
      SELECT counties.st,
             population,
             plants,
             round((plants/population::numeric(10,1)) * 1000000, 1) AS per_million
      FROM counties JOIN plants
      ON counties.st = plants.st
      ORDER BY per_million DESC;



- Cross Tabulations

    Cross tabulations provide a simple way to summarize and compare variables by displaying them
      in a matrix.  Cross tabulations are also known as 'pivot tables' or 'crosstabs'.  They are
      often used to report summaries of survey results or to compare sets of variables.  


    # Install the Postgres 'tablefunc' module to get crosstab
    CREATE EXTENSION tablefunc;


    # Create table for survey results
    CREATE TABLE ice_cream_survey (
        response_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
        office varchar(20),
        flavor varchar(20)
    );

    # Load survey results
    COPY ice_cream_survey
    FROM '~/Directory/ice_cream_survey.csv'
    WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);


    # Look at the survey results
    SELECT *
    FROM ice_cream_survey
    LIMIT 5;

    response_id    office      flavor
    -----------    --------    ----------
              1    Uptown      Chocolate
              2    Midtown     Chocolate
              3    Downtown    Strawberry
              4    Uptown      Chocolate
              5    Midtown     Chocolate


    # Get survey results by office
    #
    # First subquery generates the data for the crosstab and has 3 required columns
    #     1. First column supplies row names
    #     2. Second column supplies column names
    #     3. Third column supplies values for each cell
    #
    # Second subquery produces set of category names for the columns
    #
    # AS clause specifies names and data types of crosstab's output columns
    #     (must match output of second subquery)

    SELECT *
    FROM crosstab('SELECT office,
                          flavor,
                          count(*)
                    FROM ice_cream_survey
                    GROUP BY office, flavor
                    ORDER BY office',
  
                  'SELECT flavor
                    FROM ice_cream_survey
                    GROUP BY flavor
                    ORDER BY flavor')
  
    AS (office varchar(20),
        chocolate bigint,
        strawberry bigint,
        vanilla bigint);  


    office      chocolate    strawberry    vanilla
    --------    ---------    ----------    -------
    Downtown           23            32         19
    Midtown            41                       23
    Uptown             22            17         23



- Example - Crosstab of City Temperature Readings

    SELECT *
    FROM crosstab('SELECT
                       station_name,
                       date_part(''month'', observation_date),
                       percentile_cont(.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY max_temp)
                   FROM temperature_readings
                   GROUP BY station_name, date_part(''month'', observation_date)
                   ORDER BY station_name',
    
                  'SELECT month
                   FROM generate_series(1,12) month')

- Reclassifying Values with CASE

    The CASE statement is a conditional expression.  For data analysis, it's handy for 
      reclassifying values into categories.


    # CASE Syntax
    CASE WHEN condition THEN result
         WHEN other_condition THEN result
         ELSE result
    END


    # Example
    SELECT max_temp,
           CASE WHEN max_temp >= 90 THEN 'Hot'
                WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 70 AND 89 THEN 'Warm'
                WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 50 AND 69 THEN 'Pleasant'
                WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 33 AND 49 THEN 'Cold'
                WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 20 AND 32 THEN 'Freezing'
                ELSE 'Inhumane'
           END AS temperature_group
    FROM temperature_readings;



- Example - Using CASE in a CTE

    WITH temps_collapsed (station_name, max_temperature_group) AS
        (SELECT station_name,
               CASE WHEN max_temp >= 90 THEN 'Hot'
                    WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 70 AND 89 THEN 'Warm'
                    WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 50 AND 69 THEN 'Pleasant'
                    WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 33 AND 49 THEN 'Cold'
                    WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 20 AND 32 THEN 'Freezing'
                    ELSE 'Inhumane'
                END
         FROM temperature_readings)
  
    SELECT station_name, max_temperature_group, count(*)
    FROM temps_collapsed
    GROUP BY station_name, max_temperature_group
    ORDER BY station_name, count(*) DESC;
