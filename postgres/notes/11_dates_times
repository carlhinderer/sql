CHAPTER 11 - DATES AND TIMES
---------------------------------------------------

- Date and Time Data Types

    - date = only the date
           = using the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD is recommended

    - time = only the time
           = adding 'with time zone' makes the column time zone aware
           = using the ISO 8601 format HH:MM:SS is recommended
           = can add an optional time zone designator

    - timestamp = records the date and time
                = can add 'with time zone' to make the column time zone aware
                = the format 'timestamp' with time zone is part of the SQL standard
                = PostgreSQL also has the shorthand timestamptz, which has the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ
                = can specify time zones in 3 different formats: UTC offset, area/location designator, 
                                                                 or standard abbreviation

    - interval = holds a value that represents a unit of time expressed in the format 'quantity unit'
               = doesnâ€™t record the start or end of a period, only its duration
               = examples include 12 days or 8 hours

    All four data types can track the system clock and the nuances of the calendar. For example, date and 
      timestamp recognize that June has 30 days. Therefore, June 31 is an invalid 'datetime' value that 
      causes the database to throw an error. Likewise, the date February 29 is valid only in a leap year, 
      such as 2020.



- Extracting the Components of a Timestamp

    # The 'date_part' function extracts a single value
    SELECT
        date_part('year', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "year",
        date_part('month', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "month",
        date_part('day', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "day",
        date_part('hour', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "hour",
        date_part('minute', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "minute",
        date_part('seconds', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "seconds",
        date_part('timezone_hour', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "tz",
        date_part('week', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "week",
        date_part('quarter', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "quarter",
        date_part('epoch', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "epoch";

    year    month    day    hour    minute    seconds    tz    week    quarter    epoch
    ----    -----    ---    ----    ------    -------    --    ----    -------    ----------
    2019       12      1      18        37         12    -5      48          4    1575243432


    # The SQL-standard 'extract' function does the same thing
    SELECT
        extract('year' from '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "year";



- Creating Datetime Values from Timestamp Components

    It's not unusual to come across a data set in which the year, month, and day exist in 
      separate columns.  Sometimes, it's helpful to combine them into a single datetime
      value.


    # Make datetime objects
    make_date(year, month, day)
    make_time(hour, minute, seconds)
    make_timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, time zone)


    # Examples
    SELECT make_date(2018, 2, 22);
    SELECT make_time(18, 4, 30.3);
    SELECT make_timestamptz(2018, 2, 22, 18, 4, 30.3, 'Europe/Lisbon');

    2018-02-22
    18:04:30.3
    2018-02-22 13:04:30.3-05



- Retrieving the Current Date and Time

    # Functions to get current date and time
    current_date
    current_time
    current_timestamp   OR   now()
    loacltime
    localtimestamp


    Note that these functions record the time at the start of the query, so they'll provide
      the same time throughout the execution of the query regardless of how long the query
      runs.  

    If we want to instead reflect how the clock changes during the execution of the query,
      we can use the Postgres-specific 'clock_timestamp()' function to record the current
      time as it elapses.


    # Use current_timestamp and clock_timestamp()
    CREATE TABLE current_time_example (
        time_id bigserial,
        current_timestamp_col timestamp with time zone,
        clock_timestamp_col timestamp with time zone
    );
    
    INSERT INTO current_time_example (current_timestamp_col, clock_timestamp_col)
        (SELECT current_timestamp,
                clock_timestamp()
         FROM generate_series(1,1000));
    
    SELECT * FROM current_time_example;



- Working with Time Zones

    # Find the time zone setting of your db server
    SHOW timezone;


    # List all time zone names, abbreviations, and their UTC offsets
    SELECT * FROM pg_timezone_abbrevs;
    SELECT * FROM pg_timezone_names;


    # Look up location names or time zones
    SELECT *
    FROM pg_timezone_names
    WHERE name LIKE 'Europe%';

    name                abbrev    utc_offset    is_dst
    ----------------    ------    ----------    ------
    Europe/Amsterdam    CEST      02:00:00      t
    Europe/Andorra      CEST      02:00:00      t
    Europe/Astrakhan    +04       04:00:00      f
    Europe/Athens       EEST      03:00:00      t
    Europe/Belfast      BST       01:00:00      t
    --snip--    



- Setting the Time Zone

    When Postgres was installed, the default time zone was set in 'postgresql.conf'.  To 
      change it, we must edit the file and restart the server.  However, we can more easily
      change the pgAdmin client's time zone on a per-session basis, which will persist
      as long as we're connected to the server.


    # Change time zone in current session
    SET timezone TO 'US/Pacific';

    # Insert a datetime value
    CREATE TABLE time_zone_test (
        test_date timestamp with time zone
    );
    INSERT INTO time_zone_test VALUES ('2020-01-01 4:00');


    # Get date time in 'US/Pacific'
    SELECT test_date
    FROM time_zone_test;

    test_date
    ----------------------
    2020-01-01 04:00:00-08


    # Change time zone
    SET timezone TO 'US/Eastern';


    # Get date time in 'US/Eastern'
    SELECT test_date
    FROM time_zone_test;


    # Get date time in 'Asia/Seoul'
    SELECT test_date AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Seoul'
    FROM time_zone_test;

    timezone
    -------------------
    2020-01-01 21:00:00



- Calculations with Dates and Times

    We can perform simple arithmetic on datetime and interval types the same way we can on
      numbers.  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can all be used.


    SELECT '9/30/1929'::date - '9/27/1929'::date;

    Returns
    -------
    3


    SELECT '9/30/1929'::date + '5 years'::interval;

    Returns
    -------
    timestamp(2034, 9, 30)



- Finding Patterns in NYC Taxi Data

    # Set timezone
    SET timezone TO 'US/Eastern';


    # Count rides by hour using pickup time
    SELECT
        date_part('hour', tpep_pickup_datetime) AS trip_hour,
        count(*)
    FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_trips_2016_06_01
    GROUP BY trip_hour
    ORDER BY trip_hour;
