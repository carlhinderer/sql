CHAPTER 2 - SELECT
---------------------------------------------------

- Basic Selection

    # Select all columns
    SELECT * FROM teachers;

    # Select subset of columns
    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM teachers;



- Selecting Unique Values

    # Select distinct values in a column
    SELECT DISTINCT school
    FROM teachers;

    # Return unique pairs of values
    SELECT school, salary
    FROM teachers;



- Selecting With Ordering

    # Sorting results
    SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
    FROM teachers
    ORDER BY salary DESC;


    # Sort on mulitple columns
    SELECT last_name, school, hire_date
    FROM teachers
    ORDER BY school ASC, hire_date DESC;

    last_name    school                 hire_date

- Filtering Rows

    # Filter rows
    SELECT last_name, school, hire_date
    FROM teachers
    WHERE school = 'Myers Middle School';


    # Postgres Comparison and Matching Operators
    =                # Equal To
    <> or !=         # Not Equal To
    > >= < <=        # Greater and Less Than

    BETWEEN          # Within a range (WHERE salary BETWEEN 20000 AND 40000)
    IN               # Match in a set (WHERE last_name IN ('Smith', 'Jones'))
    LIKE             # Match a pattern case-sensitive (WHERE first_name LIKE 'Sam%')
    ILIKE            # Match a patter case-insensitive (WHERE first_name ILIKE 'sam%')
    NOT              # Negates a condition (WHERE first_name NOT ILIKE 'sam%')


    # LIKE and ILIKE Wildcards
    %                # Matches one or more characters (LIKE '%ak%')
    _                # Matches one character (LIKE '_aker')


    # Combining Operators
    AND              # AND 2 conditions (WHERE school = 'Myers' AND salary < 40000)
    OR               # OR 2 conditions (WHERE last_name = 'Cole' OR last_name = 'Bush')



- Combined Queries

    # Combined query form
    SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE criteria
    ORDER BY column_names;


    # Example Combined Query
    SELECT first_name, last_name, school, hire_date, salary
    FROM teachers
    WHERE school LIKE '%Roos%'
    ORDER BY hire_date DESC;



- Exercises

    # The school district superintendent asks for a list of teachers in each school. Write a 
    #   query that lists the schools in alphabetical order along with teachers ordered by 
    #   last name Aâ€“Z.
    SELECT school, first_name, last_name
    FROM teachers
    ORDER BY school ASC, last_name ASC;
    

    # Write a query that finds the one teacher whose first name starts with the letter S and 
    #   who earns more than $40,000.
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM teachers
    WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' AND salary > 40000;


    # Rank teachers hired since January 1, 2010, ordered by highest paid to lowest.
    SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
    FROM teachers
    WHERE hire_date >= '2010-01-01'
    ORDER BY salary DESC;
