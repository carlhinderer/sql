5. Delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

   (https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/)

   -- Right Answer in Normal SQL
   DELETE
   FROM Person
   WHERE id NOT IN (
       SELECT min(id)
       FROM Person
       GROUP BY email
   );

   -- You have to do this in MySQL, since you can't use same relation in nested query
   DELETE FROM Person
   WHERE ID NOT IN (
       SELECT * FROM
       (SELECT MIN(id)
       FROM Person
       GROUP BY email) AS Person2
   );
